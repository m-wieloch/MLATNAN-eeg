# Machine Learning applied to Neuroimaging and Neuroscience

## MLATNAN EEG Epilepsy Recognition

Overview, used dataset and architectures.

### Overview

The project aims to apply machine learning techniques to neuroimaging data, specifically using EEG (electroencephalogram) data, for the recognition and analysis of epileptic seizures.

### Dataset - [Epileptic Seizure Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harunshimanto/epileptic-seizure-recognition)
- **Number of Records:** 11,500
- **Number of Features:** 179 EEG measurements, 1 target variable ('y')
- **Data Characteristics:** The dataset comprises EEG data points representing different time stamps or electrode readings, along with a classification label for seizure recognition.

### Methodology - architectures

The Jupyter Notebook indicates a methodical approach involving data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of machine learning algorithms. The specifics of the algorithms used and the data preprocessing steps would be detailed in the notebook.

### Conclusion

The project would present findings on the effectiveness of various machine learning models in classifying EEG data for seizure recognition. This could include model accuracy, precision and recall. The conclusion section would likely summarize the key insights gained, the performance of the models, and potential areas for further research or improvement in seizure detection using EEG data.
